# Team roles:

This project consists of two questions. Question 1 consists of creating a hierarchical Table of Contents from Data Science and Predictive Analytics by Ivo D. Dinov. Question 1 was done by Sam Goodell and Chushmitha Battula. Question 2 consists of conducting an analysis of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte by preprocessing the text and implementing different text analysis. Question 2 was done by Andrea Caceres and Samanwita Mukherjee. Andrea Caceres and Samanwita finished the code by working individually then during a meeting, combining their code together. 

Sam Goodell navigated planning zoom calls by finding times that worked for the group. Andrea Caceres created a group chat with everyone in order to easily discuss logistics.
